# RSScalator
A utility that searches for RSS feeds from a CSV list of URLs

Thanks to @markditsworth for helping me make this happen

RSScalator is a Python script that takes a csv list that you have containing URLs and checks to see if an RSS feed exists for them. If an RSS feed exists, it will save that feed URL to a new csv.
